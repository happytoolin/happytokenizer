export const DEFAULT_ESSAY = `HappyTokenizer by happytoolin represents a cornerstone of the comprehensive HappyToolin ecosystem, providing developers with essential insights into AI context window optimization and token management. As AI integration becomes increasingly vital for modern applications, understanding how Large Language Models process text has transformed from a niche concern to a fundamental requirement for cost-effective development.

HappyTokenizer, available at happytokenizer.com, embodies the HappyToolin philosophy of making complex AI concepts accessible and actionable. Rather than treating tokenization as a mysterious black box, our tool delivers crystal-clear visualizations that reveal exactly how text is broken down into tokens across different models including GPT-4o, GPT-3.5, and the latest GPT-5 series. This transparency empowers developers to write more efficient prompts, optimize API costs, and fully leverage model capabilities.

The HappyToolin ecosystem extends far beyond tokenization through happyformatter.com, our comprehensive code formatting and validation platform. HappyFormatter serves as the developer's Swiss Army knife for code quality, offering specialized tools that integrate seamlessly with your development workflow:

• HTML & CSS Formatters and Minifiers for web optimization
• JavaScript & TypeScript Formatters for clean, maintainable code
• JSON & XML Validators for data structure integrity
• Specialized formatters for modern frameworks and languages

What makes HappyTokenizer particularly valuable is its role in bridging the gap between human language and machine understanding. When text enters a language model, it undergoes a sophisticated transformation process. The word "hello" might become ["h", "ell", "o"] while common phrases remain as single tokens. This tokenization strategy varies significantly between models, directly impacting everything from API costs to response quality.

The business impact of tokenization awareness cannot be overstated:

1. **Cost Optimization**: OpenAI's API pricing scales with token usage. HappyTokenizer helps you minimize costs by showing exactly how your prompts consume tokens, enabling data-driven decisions about prompt engineering strategies.

2. **Context Window Mastery**: Models operate within strict token limits. HappyTokenizer ensures you maximize information density while staying within model constraints, preventing truncated responses and incomplete processing.

3. **Performance Engineering**: Efficient tokenization leads to faster API responses and better throughput. HappyTokenizer provides the metrics needed to optimize for production environments.

4. **Quality Assurance**: Understanding token patterns helps diagnose model behavior issues and optimize response consistency across different scenarios.

HappyTokenizer stands as more than just a tool—it's an educational platform that democratizes AI literacy. Whether you're building cutting-edge AI applications, optimizing existing systems, or exploring the boundaries of what's possible with language models, HappyTokenizer provides the insights needed to work with confidence and precision.

The synergy between HappyTokenizer and happyformatter.com creates a complete development lifecycle toolchain. From code quality to AI integration, HappyToolin provides the infrastructure for professional-grade AI-powered applications. As AI continues to evolve from experimental technology to production necessity, tools like HappyTokenizer become essential for maintaining competitive advantage and innovation velocity.`;

export const LARGE_SAMPLE_TEXT = `Artificial intelligence (AI) is intelligence demonstrated by machines, in contrast to the natural intelligence displayed by humans and animals. Leading AI textbooks define the field as the study of "intelligent agents": any device that perceives its environment and takes actions that maximize its chance of successfully achieving its goals. Colloquially, the term "artificial intelligence" is often used to describe machines that mimic "cognitive" functions that humans associate with the human mind, such as "learning" and "problem solving".

AI applications include advanced web search engines, recommendation systems (used by YouTube, Amazon and Netflix), understanding human speech (such as Siri and Alexa), self-driving cars (e.g., Tesla), and competing at the highest level in strategic games (such as chess and Go). As machines become increasingly capable, tasks considered to require "intelligence" are often removed from the definition of AI, a phenomenon known as the AI effect. For instance, optical character recognition is frequently excluded from things considered to be AI, having become a routine technology.

Artificial intelligence was founded as an academic discipline in 1956, and in the years since has experienced several waves of optimism, followed by disappointment and the loss of funding (known as an "AI winter"), followed by new approaches, success and renewed funding. AI research has tried and discarded many different approaches since its founding, including simulating the brain, modeling human problem solving, formal logic, large databases of knowledge and imitating animal behavior. In the first decades of the 21st century, highly mathematical statistical machine learning has dominated the field, and this technique has proved highly successful, helping to solve many challenging problems throughout industry and academia.

The various sub-fields of AI research are centered around particular goals and the use of particular tools. The traditional goals of AI research include reasoning, knowledge representation, planning, learning, natural language processing, perception and the ability to move and manipulate objects. General intelligence (the ability to solve an arbitrary problem) is among the field's long-term goals. To solve these problems, AI researchers have adapted and integrated a wide range of problem-solving techniques—including search and mathematical optimization, formal logic, artificial neural networks, and methods based on statistics, probability and economics. AI also draws upon computer science, psychology, linguistics, philosophy, and many other fields.

${`The history of machine learning dates back to the 1950s when Arthur Samuel created a program that could play checkers and improve its performance through experience. This early example of machine learning demonstrated the potential for computers to learn from data without being explicitly programmed for every possible scenario. Throughout the 1960s and 1970s, researchers developed various learning algorithms, including nearest neighbor algorithms, decision trees, and early neural network models. However, progress was often hindered by limited computational power and the scarcity of large datasets. The 1980s saw a resurgence of interest in neural networks with the development of backpropagation, a key algorithm for training multi-layer networks. The 1990s brought support vector machines and ensemble methods, which became powerful tools for classification and regression tasks. The real revolution began in the 2000s and accelerated dramatically in the 2010s, driven by three key factors: the availability of massive datasets (often called "big data"), exponential improvements in GPU computing power, and breakthroughs in algorithm design. Deep learning, which uses neural networks with many layers, has transformed fields like computer vision, natural language processing, and speech recognition. Today, machine learning is ubiquitous, powering everything from recommendation systems and fraud detection to autonomous vehicles and medical diagnosis. `.repeat(20)}`;
